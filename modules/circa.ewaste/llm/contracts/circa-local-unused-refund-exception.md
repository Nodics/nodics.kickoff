# Local Original Unused Coupon Exception

The operator authorized one native `kickoffLocal` exception for the original
unused 50-POINTS purchase on 2026-10-09. This is not a new credit, a campaign
policy change, a missing-policy default or permission to reverse redeemed
benefits. Original purchase terms remain immutable.

| Binding | Exact Reviewed Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant / marketplace | `default` / `GREENPERKS_ONLINE` |
| Original buyer | `customer@circa.local` |
| Original Order | `CIRCA_ORDER_261009:GP-A01-UNUSED-REFUND:order` |
| Original review case | `ORDER_REVIEW_EBAABBBC41098AF799F44B680CDDD130` |
| Original entitlement | `digitalEntitlement:5ea8973f942b650766948c9ef9b163fbe84a4a28` |
| Original purchased coupon | `CIRCA_COUPON_GP-A01_BATCH:1` |
| Maximum effect | Full original capture of 50 POINTS, once |

## Repeatable Setup

Select the independent `circa.ewaste:circaLocalUnusedRefundExceptionRole`
sample release on PLATFORM, then
`circa.ewaste:circaLocalUnusedRefundExceptionStaffAssignment`. Both are
explicit Local-only REFERENCE selections in `sample-v001`, version `0.0.1`.
The first defines only `commerce.refund.exception.adjudicate`; the second adds
`CIRCA_LOCAL_UNUSED_REFUND_EXCEPTION` to the original
`circa-online-administrator` through Profile's additive reference-group owner.
Neither selection changes credentials, replaces prior groups, grants scopes,
executes Payment or supplies a financial approval. Existing refund-review and
execution permissions remain independently required.

The exact original case/purchase binding belongs to the native Commerce server
configuration, not to reusable framework defaults or the role. Docker and
non-Local runtimes remain disabled. Future fresh demos must obtain their own
reviewed exact exception, or publish an independently reviewed refund policy
before purchases. Never retarget installed historical purchases to make a test
pass and never reimport the original credit or wallet snapshot.

## Owner Execution And Evidence

Order owns explicit adjudication and immutable audited case evidence. It must
freshly authorize the genuine human through Profile, confirm the exact original
Payment capture and complete single unused Digital purchase, and persist a
single acknowledged revision update with uncached readback. A missing refund
policy is the only reviewed exception; explicit policy denial, foreign scope,
claimed/redeemed coupons, mixed orders and uncertain owner evidence still deny.

Adjudication alone does not move POINTS. The normal refund preview and approval
then run through Order, Digital, Promotion, Payment and Loyalty. Digital accepts
only Order's private phase-bound authority, never a body flag, copied context or
the role alone. All phases retain their normal recovery and replay identities.
The separately purchased/redeemed main `GP-A01` must remain untouched.

Acceptance requires original Order `REFUNDED`, entitlement `REVOKED`, one
original-capture-linked 50-POINTS Loyalty reversal, unchanged replay and fresh
buyer balance of 1,483 POINTS before the nine monetary purchases. The nine cost
exactly 1,483 POINTS; no additional funding is authorized. Existing 29 ITEM
receipts remain explicitly simulated delivery. Real goods delivery, real AED
payment, merchant POS settlement and redeemed-benefit reversals remain outside
this Local qualification.
