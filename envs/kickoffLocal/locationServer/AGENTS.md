# locationServer Agents

Follow the root Nodics AI agent contract before changing this boundary:

- root `README.md` explains the human/documentation route.
- root `AGENTS.md` governs repository-wide AI and contributor behavior.
- Read every applicable ancestor `AGENTS.md` from root to this module before editing.
- Read this module `README.md`, `llm/contracts`, `llm/examples`, and generated context.

This generated server boundary must preserve Nodics structure, layering, configuration-first behavior, override/customization contracts, tests, documentation, and generated-artifact discipline.

Before implementing non-trivial behavior here, record the business outcome, owning layer, studied sources, current implementation, extension path, security/tenant/data/API/release impact, intended files, and validation route.

This Local deployment declares a distinct runtime instance and an environment
reference for its retained service proof. Profile must hold the corresponding
service principal and approved deployment grant before startup. Missing proof
fails closed; never replace it with the shared bootstrap or administrator key.
After a full Local reset, an authenticated operator must reprovision the approved
deployment grants through Profile before restarting this runtime.
