Use this README to understand what this module is for, which capability or composition boundary it owns, how it fits its parent hierarchy, and where developers or AI tools should continue reading.

This Local deployment declares a distinct runtime instance and an environment
reference for its retained service proof. Profile must hold the corresponding
service principal and approved deployment grant before startup. Missing proof
fails closed; never replace it with the shared bootstrap or administrator key.
After a full Local reset, an authenticated operator must reprovision the approved
deployment grants through Profile before restarting this runtime.
